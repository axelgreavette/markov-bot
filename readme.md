# Markov Bot

A Markov-Chain Discord bot written in Node.js.

## Usage:

This bot is *super* easy to get up and running...

### Prerequisites:
- Discord Bot Token

### Step One:
Clone this Git Repo using the following (or a similar) command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/axelgreavette/markov-bot.git
```
Navigate to the folder where you cloned it:
```bash
cd markov-bot
```
### Step Two:
Install the bot's dependencies from NPM using the following command:
```bash
npm install
```
### Step Three:
Open `./config.example.json` in a text editor and fill out the following information:
- `token`: Your Discord Bot token
- `adminID`: Your Discord User ID.
Once you've done that save and rename it to `./config.json`.
## Step Four:
~~Profit.~~

Now in a shell or console simply run one of the following:
- `npm start`
- `node .`
- `node src/bot.js`

All of them do the same thing, so it's just a matter of ~~style~~ preference.
